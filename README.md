## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in building modern web applications with a focus on performance, user experience, and clean code. Whether it's a dynamic single-page application or a robust backend service, I enjoy the entire development lifecycle from concept to deployment.

When I'm not working with JavaScript, you'll find me experimenting with Python projects just for fun, exploring new technologies, and contributing to the developer community.
